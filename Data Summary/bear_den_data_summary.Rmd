# Rates of re-use

For now, I'm counting `Unknown`s the same as `Not Active`.

This is a quick and dirty assignment of 're-use' - it doesn't take into account if there's been a large temporal gap (e.g., years) between visits.

But, essentially, if the status was `Active` for two records in a row, it's counted as *re-used*.

```{r re-use data prep}
# Arrange table by den_id and date_inspected
f <- f[order(f$den_id, f$date_inspected),]
# Add in a cumulative visit col by each den - i.e. the Nth field visit to the given den
f <- f |>
  dplyr::group_by(den_id) |>    
  dplyr::mutate(cumulative_visit = cumsum(!is.na(den_id)))
# Create `reuse_yn` col - if den was revisited at all
f <- f |> 
    dplyr::group_by(den_id) |>
    dplyr::mutate(count_active = sum(den_status_binary == "Active"),
                  reuse_yn = count_active > 1)
# Create `consecutiveuse_yn` col - if den visited two years in a row
f <- f |> 
  dplyr::group_by(den_id) |>
  dplyr::mutate(year_diff = lubridate::year(date_inspected) - dplyr::lag(lubridate::year(date_inspected))) |> # so cumulative visits only count if they're one year apart (e.g., a visit in 2016 and then in 2020 is NOT a cumulative visit)
  dplyr::mutate(consecutiveuse_yn = ifelse((cumulative_visit == 1 & year_diff == 1),
                                  # If it's the first visit to the den, set `reuse_yn` == NA
                                  NA, 
                                  # Else if it's NOT the first visit, and the previous record says "Active", set `reuse_yn` == TRUE
                                  (dplyr::lag(den_status_binary) == "Active" & den_status_binary == "Active"))

# Forestry vs. Den Status

Now, we need to do a bit of data wrangling. In theory, the den status of **the current year** is influenced by the forestry data **from the year before**. So, we match the den status with last year's forestry data from our field visits. In doing so, this cuts our dataset own to `r nrow(f_analysis)` records. 

With the exception of age class and canopy closure, all subsequent plots show den status of year *N* versus forestry data from year *N - 1*. Age class and canopy closure were only measured once in the study (at the first den visit).

## Comparing pseudo data to real data

Takeaways: 
- Randomly sampled points on the landscape are overwhelmingly more likely to have 100% forest coverage within 60 meters than our bear dens.
- The mean distance to recent cutblocks (forest <40 yo) is **significantly higher** for randomly sampled points than for our bear dens.
- For both random data points and bear dens, they are both more likely to be within a patch of mature forest (>40 yo) than not.
- The mean distance to nearest road is **significantly higher** for randomly sampled points than for our bear dens.
- Randomly sampled points, on average, have a higher proportion of old growth forest (age class > 7) within 1.5km than our bear dens.
- Our bears live in **dynamic landscapes**!

---

## Comparing pseudo data to real data

Ultimately, I think it's safe to say we *do not* have a random sample of dens, when it comes to both forestry treatments and geography.

---

# Overall data summary

Good news:
- Considering the amount of effort it takes to collect this data, we have a large sample size across a large swath of the province
- This is the first dataset of its kind (to our knowledge)
- We can supplement this data with the huge backlog of camera data

Limitations:
- We don't have a large sample size -> low statistical power
- We don't have much variation between our various variables
- We don't have a representative (random) sample
- Uneven sampling effort across years and regions

# Our research questions

Now we have had a nice and detailed tour of the data. What are our research questions? What can we try to answer with this data?

---

# Our research questions

In a nutshell:

1. Does the stand condition around the den influence den activity (Active vs. Not active)?
2. Do non-forestry conditions (e.g., den characteristics) influence den activity?
3. Does forestry treatement affect windthrow impacts?
4. Does current management align with recommendations?

# Question 1: Does stand condition affect den activity?

Let's focus on this one.

---

## Question 1

**Question:** How does stand-level condition, including distance to road, proportion forested, and distance to edge, and landscape-level condition (road density, proportion <40 years, proportion >250 years within 1.5km), relate to den use the following winter?

---

## Question 1

**Question:** How does stand-level condition, including distance to road, proportion forested, and distance to edge, and landscape-level condition (road density, proportion <40 years, proportion >250 years within 1.5km), relate to den use the following winter?

**Prediction:** The likelihood of den use over time is positively correlated with distance to <40 years, distance to road, proportion forested, and negatively correlated with distance to >40 years. Landscape condition may have different responses based on condition; at very low road density, and low <40 years, and high >250 years, den use may be less correlated with stand-level condition as we presume more options for bear to use, which means den use may be lower or more sensitive to stand-level variation.

---

## Question 1

Candidate models:

```
den status ~ year                # control for yearly variation in bear activity
den status ~ region              # do dens have different usage by region?
den status ~ proportion forested # do dens with more intact forest have more activity?
den status ~ distance <40        # do dens further from cutblocks have more activity?
den status ~ distance >40        # do dens further from old growth have less activity?
den status ~ distance to road    # do dens further from roads have more activity?
den status ~ road density        # do dens with higher road density have less activity?
den status ~ stand age           # do dens in older stand age have more activity?
den status ~ % old growth        # do dens with higher % old growth nearby have more activity?
den status ~ % new growth        # do dens with higher % new growth nearby have less activity?

# + interactions with stand age
den status ~ distance to road * stand age # does distance to road matter in old vs young stands?
```

Though, note that all models include `+ age + year` to control for whether the den is in intact mature forest vs a cutblock plus control for yearly variation in activity.

---

## Question 1

In addition to these simple one variable models, we also tried a "kitchen sink" approach, with all non-correlated variables within a single model:

```
# Kitchen sink 1
den status ~ year + region + proportion forested + 
             distance to edge * stand age + 
             road density

# Kitchen sink 2
den status ~ year + region + proportion forested +
             distance to road * stand age
```

---

## Question 1

Data summary: 
- Colinear model terms are excluded from the full "kitchen sink" model.
- Data are strictly filtered down to "Active" and "Not Active" dens where we _for sure_ know the den status. I.e., exluding "Active within past 4 years" or "Unknown" status dens.

---

## Question 1

By far and away, our base model `model00` is consistently one of the top models, in any variation of models we tried.

```{r den status models}
# The modeling data
dat <- f_analysis[f_analysis$den_status_binary %in% c("Active", "Not Active") & f_analysis$den_status %in% for_sure_dens, ]

# Confirm that a strict vs lenient "for sure dens" doesn't change the results!
#dat <- f_analysis[f_analysis$den_status_binary %in% c("Active", "Not Active"), ]

# Confirm that using the regular `f` dataset (the one that DOESN'T match to 
# previous years' forestry) produces results that don't make sense
# It still produces the same top model, but 2022-2024 show HUGE
# confidence intervals. Anything <2020 is cut out entirely, bc it's not
# matched to GIS. All-in-all better to use `f_analysis`.

## Question 1

`model00` happens to be the base model that simply tries to control for decreases in bear den activity (because of low rates of reuse) as a result of more dens monitored over time...

```{r}
summary(model00)
```

---

## Question 1

```{r n field visits per year 2}
f |> 
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(date_inspected)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             fill = den_status_binary)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2014:2024) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "N field visits",
       title = "Number of field visits per year") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

---

## Question 1

```{r n active per year}
f |> 
  dplyr::filter(den_status_binary == "Active") |>
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(date_inspected)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             fill = den_status_binary)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2014:2024) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "N field visits",
       title = "Number of field visits per year") +
  theme_minimal() 
```

---

## Question 1

And it so happens that, because of the really low den re-use rate, as time goes on, the likelihood of a den being active again is quite low. Therefore, as `year` increases, your likelihood of being an "Active" den _decreases_.

```{r effect plot model00, fig.height = 5}
sjPlot::plot_model(model00, type = "pred")
```

---

## Question 1

But what about the top model???

.small-code[
```{r top model summary}
models <- bbmle::AICtab(models_list, weights = TRUE)
top_model <- row.names(as.data.frame(models))[[1]]
summary(get(top_model))
```
]

---

## Question 1: Top Model Summary

As distance from road increases, the chances of being "Active" also go up - even after controlling for `year`.

```{r den status v dist_road pred plot, fig.height = 5}
sjPlot::plot_model(get(top_model), type = "pred", terms = c("dist_road[all]"))
```

---

## Question 1: Top Model Summary

It gets complicated when we look at the interaction with age. There's more to tease out from these results. In short, the distance from the edge of the block matters _more_ in young stands than old.

```{r den status v dist_road x age pred plot, fig.height = 5}
sjPlot::plot_model(get(top_model), type = "pred", terms = c("dist_road[all]", "age"))
```

---

## Question 1: Top Model Summary

The relationship is different between young stands versus old, mature stands. If a den is **close to a road** and **within a cutblock**, it's statistically more likely to be **NOT ACTIVE!**

```{r den status v age x dist_road boxplot, fig.height = 5}
dat |>
  dplyr::mutate(den_status_binary = factor(den_status_binary)) |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(age)) |>

                       y = log_dist_road,
                       color = den_status_binary)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA) +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggsignif::geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("0.within_young", "1.within_young"),
                                           c("1.within_young", "0.within_old"),

                        map_signif_level = TRUE,

```

## Question 1: Top Model 2 Summary

The next-best fit is the model that incorporates distance from mature stands (`dist_gt40`).

.small-code[
```{r}
#top_model2 <- row.names(as.data.frame(models))[[2]]
top_model2 <- "model0c"
summary(get(top_model2))
```
]

---

## Question 1: Top Model 2 Summary

The next-best fit is the model that incorporates distance from mature stands (`dist_gt40`). Not clear what's going on here!

```{r effect plot dist_road x age, fig.height = 5}
sjPlot::plot_model(get(top_model2), type = "pred", terms = c("dist_gt40[all]"))
```


```{r r den status v age x dist_from_edge boxplot, fig.height = 5, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
## Keeping this code bc it's handy, but it's no longer in the top model, so not showing it in the slides.

## In general, dens within old/mature stands tend to be further from the cutblock edge, while dens within young/cutblock stands tend to be close to the edge of mature forests.

## Question 1

When we go more lenient with our strict data criteria, and decide to include "Active within last 4 years" as "Active", rather than "Unknown", we get nearly identical results. 

---

## Question 1 _ish_ (hair model)

Activity status in general is fairly objective and can be difficult to define. There were a fair bit of 'Uknown' den statuses. What if we are interested in seeing whether or not a den was checked out _at all_?

What about modeling the response variable as `hair_in_bed`?

What about modeling the response variable as `hair_in_bed`?
- It's more objective than the activity status column.
- But, it simply tells us whether or not a bear has visited the den.

## Question 1 _ish_ (hair model)

Candidate models:

```
hair in den ~ year                
hair in den ~ region + age + year           
hair in den ~ proportion forested + age + year 
hair in den ~ distance <40 + age + year        
hair in den ~ distance >40 + age + year

hair in den ~ road density + age + year        
hair in den ~ stand age + age + year           
hair in den ~ % old growth + age + year        
hair in den ~ % new growth + age + year        

# + interactions with stand age
hair in den ~ distance to road * stand age + year 

# + full model
hair in den ~ year + region + proportion forested + 
              distance to edge + stand age + 
              road density

## Question 1 _ish_ (hair model)

- `year` + `region` explained much of the variance.
- When controlling for `year` and `region`, we get something similar as with the original set of models - distance from >40 yo forest influences hair presence. The *further* from mature stands, the more likely for there to be hair!

### Question 1 _ish_ (hair model): overall summary

- `year` + `region` explained much of the variance.
- When controlling for `year` and `region`, we get something similar as with the original set of models - distance from >40 yo forest influences hair presence. The *further* from mature stands, the more likely for there to be hair!

### Question 1 _ish_ (hair model): overall summary

- The next top two, within <2 dAIC, are interesting too. 
- Top predictors are 1) _positive_ relationship with proportion of mature stands on landscape within 1.5 km radius and 2) _negative_ relationship with proportion of immature stands on landscape within 1.5 km radius.

```{r hair in bed gt8}
sjPlot::plot_model(model0i, type = "pred", terms = c("gt_8[all]", "age", "region"),
                   axis.title = c("% MATURE stands within 1.5 km", "hair in bed"))

```

---

## Question 1

Ways forward?
- Perhaps some sort of weights/error structure can account for year without it "swamping" the model?
- Perhaps a bootstrapping approach to account for uneven years sampling: pull a random year of data - one per each den - then fit the model. Do this 1000x. Take the model averages.
- Perhaps running piecewise models: one for 'pre disturbance' den data, one for 'post disturbance'?
- Non-linear modeling approaches: perhaps a principal components analysis (PCA)?
- And finally, and perhaps most likely, we simply **need a greater sample size.** A priori power analysis indicated we'd need >400 dens sampled, but the modeling dataset is only `r nrow(dat)` data points!

## Question 2

**Question:** How do intrinsic den characteristics, such as den cavity size and shape, tree species, or position on the slope relate to den use?

---

## Question 2

**Question:** How do intrinsic den characteristics, such as den cavity size and shape, tree species, or position on the slope relate to den use?

**Prediction:** The likelihood of den use is positively correlated with certain den sizes, tree species, and slopes.

---

For all the following plots, the response variable indicates whether or not the den was *ever* active (`ever_active_yn == TRUE`) or has *never* been active (`ever_active_yn == FALSE`). 
This is done to reduce psuedoreplication (many repeats of static den measurements versus changing den status each year), such that there is one data point per den (single static den measurements versus single "was the den active" response).

---

## Question 3A

**Question:** How does forestry condition, such as distance from cutblock edge, retention patch size, and harvest status influence the amount of windthrow in a given area?

**Prediction:** The probability of windthrow occuring within a given area will be greater the closer to a cutblock edge that area is. Locations within smaller retention patch sizes and within 60m of harvest are more likely to have windthrow than locations in larger retention patches and futher from harvest.

Harvest status is determined by the % tree coverage within 60m of a given point. If a road cuts through the forest OR there is forest <40 years old within 60m of that point, it counts as "harvested". Areas within 60m naturally unforested areas, such as the edge of a lake, would NOT count as "harvested" under these critera.

```{r n harvest status fig}
ggplot(f[!is.na(f$harvested), ],

## Question 3B

**Question:** How does windthrow severity influence den activity? 

**Prediction:** Dens within areas of higher windthrow severity are less likely to be active.

This question unfortunately is not so straightforward to answer. There does not seem to be a large difference in activity between still-functional den trees in severe vs. unaffected areas. In general, regardless of windthrow state, dens just aren't active very much.
