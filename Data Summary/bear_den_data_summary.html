# Rates of re-use

First need to categorize dens into `Active`, `Not Active`, or `Unknown`.
Based on the highlighted rows in the tables of the previous slides, we have:


|Den Status |  %|

# Rates of re-use

For now, I'm counting `Unknown`s the same as `Not Active`.

This is a quick and dirty assignment of 're-use' - it doesn't take into account if there's been a large temporal gap (e.g., years) between visits.

But, essentially, if the status was `Active` for two records in a row, it's counted as *re-used*.

# Forestry vs. Den Status

Now, we need to do a bit of data wrangling. In theory, the den status of **the current year** is influenced by the forestry data **from the year before**. So, we match the den status with last year's forestry data from our field visits. In doing so, this cuts our dataset own to 363 records. 

With the exception of age class and canopy closure, all subsequent plots show den status of year *N* versus forestry data from year *N - 1*. Age class and canopy closure were only measured once in the study (at the first den visit).

# How well are we sampling the landscape?

The next set of slides will compare points randomly sampled across the landscape versus our dens. Compared to just randomly dropping pins on a map of Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, how well are we sampling the landscape with our sample of dens?

30% of the randomly sampled 'pseudo dens' fall within park lands or protected areas, in contrast to only 9% of the dens sampled in this study.

## Comparing pseudo data to real data

Takeaways: 
- Randomly sampled points on the landscape are overwhelmingly more likely to have 100% forest coverage within 60 meters than our bear dens.
- The mean distance to recent cutblocks (forest &lt;40 yo) is **significantly higher** for randomly sampled points than for our bear dens.
- For both random data points and bear dens, they are both more likely to be within a patch of mature forest (&gt;40 yo) than not.
- The mean distance to nearest road is **significantly higher** for randomly sampled points than for our bear dens.
- Randomly sampled points, on average, have a higher proportion of old growth forest (age class &gt; 7) within 1.5km than our bear dens.

## Comparing pseudo data to real data

Ultimately, I think it's safe to say we *do not* have a random sample of dens, when it comes to both forestry treatments and geography.

# Overall data summary

Good news:
- Considering the amount of effort it takes to collect this data, we have a large sample size across a large swath of the province
- This is the first dataset of its kind (to our knowledge)
- We can supplement this data with the huge backlog of camera data

Limitations:
- We don't have a large sample size -&gt; low statistical power
- We don't have much variation between our various variables
- We don't have a representative (random) sample
- Uneven sampling effort across years and regions

# Our research questions

Now we have had a nice and detailed tour of the data. What are our research questions? What can we try to answer with this data?

---

# Our research questions

In a nutshell:

1. Does the stand condition around the den influence den activity (Active vs. Not active)?
2. Do non-forestry conditions (e.g., den characteristics) influence den activity?
3. Does forestry treatement affect windthrow impacts?
4. Does current management align with recommendations?

# Question 1: Does stand condition affect den activity?

Let's focus on this one.

---

## Question 1

**Question:** How does stand-level condition, including distance to road, proportion forested, and distance to edge, and landscape-level condition (road density, proportion &lt;40 years, proportion &gt;250 years within 1.5km), relate to den use the following winter?

---

## Question 1

**Question:** How does stand-level condition, including distance to road, proportion forested, and distance to edge, and landscape-level condition (road density, proportion &lt;40 years, proportion &gt;250 years within 1.5km), relate to den use the following winter?

**Prediction:** The likelihood of den use over time is positively correlated with distance to &lt;40 years, distance to road, proportion forested, and negatively correlated with distance to &gt;40 years. Landscape condition may have different responses based on condition; at very low road density, and low &lt;40 years, and high &gt;250 years, den use may be less correlated with stand-level condition as we presume more options for bear to use, which means den use may be lower or more sensitive to stand-level variation.

---

## Question 1

Candidate models:

```
den status ~ year                # control for yearly variation in bear activity
den status ~ region              # do dens have different usage by region?
den status ~ proportion forested # do dens with more intact forest have more activity?
den status ~ distance &lt;40        # do dens further from cutblocks have more activity?
den status ~ distance &gt;40        # do dens further from old growth have less activity?
den status ~ distance to road    # do dens further from roads have more activity?
den status ~ road density        # do dens with higher road density have less activity?
den status ~ stand age           # do dens in older stand age have more activity?
den status ~ % old growth        # do dens with higher % old growth nearby have more activity?
den status ~ % new growth        # do dens with higher % new growth nearby have less activity?

# + interactions with stand age
den status ~ distance to road * stand age # does distance to road matter in old vs young stands?
```

---

## Question 1

In addition to these simple one variable models, we also tried a "kitchen sink" approach, with all non-correlated variables within a single model:

```
den status ~ year + region + proportion forested + 
             distance to edge + stand age + 
             road density
```

---

## Question 1

First check for correlation between our model covariates.

---

&lt;img src="bear_den_data_summary_files/figure-html/model covariates correlation matrix-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Question 1

Data summary: 
- Colinear model terms are excluded from the full "kitchen sink" model.
- Data are strictly filtered down to "Active" and "Not Active" dens where we _for sure_ know the den status. I.e., exluding "Active within past 4 years" or "Unknown" status dens.

## Question 1

By far and away, `model00` is consistently the best fit:


```

## model0d  2.8 2  0.164

- But, it simply tells us whether or not a bear has visited the den.

## Question 1: overall summary

- No forestry variables jumped out as significantly influential on den activity status.
- Instead, `year` explained much of the variance - likely because we visited many more dens in later years rather than older years.

Ways forward?
- Perhaps some sort of weights/error structure can account for year without it "swamping" the model?
- Perhaps a bootstrapping approach to account for uneven years sampling: pull a random year of data - one per each den - then fit the model. Do this 1000x. Take the model averages.
- Perhaps running piecewise models: one for 'pre disturbance' den data, one for 'post disturbance'?
- Non-linear modeling approaches: perhaps a principal components analysis (PCA)?
- And finally, and perhaps most likely, we simply **need a greater sample size.** A priori power analysis indicated we'd need &gt;400 dens sampled, but the modeling dataset is only 286 data points!

---

## Question 2

**Question:** How do intrinsic den characteristics, such as den cavity size and shape, tree species, or position on the slope relate to den use?

**Prediction:** The likelihood of den use is positively correlated with certain den sizes, tree species, and slopes.

---

For all the following plots, the response variable indicates whether or not the den was *ever* active (`ever_active_yn == TRUE`) or has *never* been active (`ever_active_yn == FALSE`). 
This is done to reduce psuedoreplication (many repeats of static den measurements versus changing den status each year), such that there is one data point per den (single static den measurements versus single "was the den active" response).

### Chamber dimensions vs Den Status

`TRUE` = the den has been active at least one time during the monitoring period.

## Question 2

Overall, whether or not a den was ever active during the monitoring period does not appear to be significantly influenced by either den qualities (e.g. chamber width, height) or non-forestry geography (e.g., elevation, slope).

# Question 3B: Does windthrow severity affect den activity?

## Question 3A

**Question:** How does forestry condition, such as distance from cutblock edge, retention patch size, and harvest status influence the amount of windthrow in a given area?

---

## Question 3A

**Question:** How does forestry condition, such as distance from cutblock edge, retention patch size, and harvest status influence the amount of windthrow in a given area?

**Prediction:** The probability of windthrow occuring within a given area will be greater the closer to a cutblock edge that area is. Locations within smaller retention patch sizes and within 60m of harvest are more likely to have windthrow than locations in larger retention patches and futher from harvest.

Windthrow is categorized by estimating the proportion of trees within a 60m radius of a given point (lat, lon of a den) that are windthrown.

---

Harvest status is determined by the % tree coverage within 60m of a given point. If a road cuts through the forest OR there is forest &lt;40 years old within 60m of that point, it counts as "harvested". Areas within 60m naturally unforested areas, such as the edge of a lake, would NOT count as "harvested" under these critera.

&lt;img src="bear_den_data_summary_files/figure-html/n harvest status fig-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Harvested areas have significantly higher % windthrow.

---

Distance to edge is the distance to any hard forest edge caused by harvest activity, including distance to &lt;40 yo forest or distance to road (whichever was closer).

While there is a relationship between windthrow % and distance to edge, there appears to be no relationship between forest stand age class and windthrow (there were no significant differences between finer groupings of age class, either).

## Question 3B

**Question:** How does windthrow severity influence den activity? 

---

## Question 3B

**Question:** How does windthrow severity influence den activity? 

**Prediction:** Dens within areas of higher windthrow severity are less likely to be active.

---

This question unfortunately is not so straightforward to answer. There does not seem to be a large difference in activity between still-functional den trees in severe vs. unaffected areas. In general, regardless of windthrow state, dens just aren't active very much.
